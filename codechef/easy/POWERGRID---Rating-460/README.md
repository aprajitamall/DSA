A new park has been decorated with lamps for the evening.
The lamps are arranged in $R$ rows and $C$ columns. Every lamp uses $W$ watts of power.
Find the total power used by all the lamps.

### Input Format
- single line containing three space-separated integers $R$, $C$, and $W$.
### Output Format
- output a single integer representing the total power consumed by all the lamps.
### Constraints
- $1 \le R, C \le 10^2$
- $1 \le W \le 10^3$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3 4 5

```

### Explanation:

The park has $3 \times 4 = 12$ lamps. Each lamp uses $5$ watts. The total power used is $12 \times 5 = 60$ watts.
