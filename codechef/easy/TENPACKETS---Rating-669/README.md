## Problem

### Buy Ten Packets

Chef wants to buy $10$ packets of an item.

As it is festive season, Chef can buy

- $2$ packets for a total of $X$ rupees
- $4$ packets for a total of $Y$ rupees

It is known that $X \lt Y \leq 2 \cdot X$.

Determine the  **minimum**  cost Chef needs to pay to buy $10$ packets, if Chef can only buy packets of $2$ and $4$.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists two integers $X$ and $Y$, the costs of packets of $2$ and $4$ respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the  **minimum**  cost Chef needs to pay to buy $10$ packets.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X \lt Y \leq 100$
- $Y \leq 2 \cdot X$.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
5 10
8 12
98 99
1 2

```

```
25
32
296
5

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef can buy $5$ packets of two, for $5\cdot 5 = 25$ rupees. It can be shown that there is no way to buy $10$ packets for less than $25$ rupees.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef can buy $2$ packets of $4$ and $1$ packet of $2$ for $12\cdot 2 + 8\cdot 1 = 32$ rupees.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef can buy $2$ packets of $4$ and $1$ packet of $2$ for $99\cdot 2 + 98\cdot 1 = 296$ rupees.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef can buy $2$ packets of $4$ and $1$ packet of $2$ for $2\cdot 2 + 1\cdot 1 = 5$ rupees.

    while(t--){
    int x,y;
    cin>>x>>y;
    int op1=x*5;
    int op2=y+3*x;
    int op3=2*y+x;
    cout<<min({op1,op2,op3})<<endl;
